# ClickerGame: SwiftUI game

This project implements a simple clicker game inspired by Cookie Clicker in SwiftUI. The game revolves around clicking a cookie to earn points (cookies) and using those points to purchase upgrades that generate cookies automatically.

# Gameplay

* Tapping the cookie increases your cookie count.
* Purchase upgrades in the Shop view to:
  - Earn more cookies per click.
  - Generate cookies automatically at set intervals.
  - Reduce the interval between automatic cookie generation.
* The Settings view allows you to:
  - Change the game's visual theme (cookie, background, font).
  - Enable dark mode.
  - Reset the game (all progress and purchases are lost).

# Running the App

Open the project in Xcode.
Ensure you have a device or simulator connected and selected.
Click the "Run" button (play triangle) in the top left corner of Xcode.
Dependencies

# Further Enhancements

* Add more upgrade options (e.g., cookie click multipliers, different cookie types).
* Implement achievements or challenges.
* Implement a store where you can buy titles / badges or rare skins.
* Add sound effects and background music.
